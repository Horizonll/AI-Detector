I am thrilled to introduce my latest project – AI-Generated Facial Image Authentication. This cutting-edge technology has earned me the prestigious **First Prize** in the Global Campus Artificial Intelligence Algorithm Elite Competition.

Discover the heart of my award-winning AI-Generated Facial Image Authentication project. The source code for my innovative algorithm, which integrates EfficientNet and Bagging techniques, is now available on GitHub. This repository is a treasure trove for those interested in deep learning, image recognition, and advanced authentication systems.

Feel free to dive into the code and understand the mechanics behind the algorithm that won the Global Campus Artificial Intelligence Algorithm Elite Competition. You can find the repository at the following link: https://github.com/Horizonll/AI-Detector

I look forward to your feedback and contributions!
